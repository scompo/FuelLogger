#Good to know

This project was developed using the android SDK and the Eclipse plugin. It should also work to be compiled with the sdk alone.
I've chosen an open source license to share the code to the world, hoping it can be useful in anyway to someone. There are some
basic sqlite interaction and some Fragment management in it too. Right now it's a bit empty because it just started. In the future
I hope it would get nice and clean to use and to modify if needed.
